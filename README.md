## Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, you need to have **Java** installed on your computer.

### 1. Install Java 21 (JDK)
This project requires **Java 21**. A "JDK" (Java Development Kit) contains the tools needed to develop and run Java applications.

**For Windows / macOS / Linux:**
1. Go to the [Adoptium Eclipse Temurin Website](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=21) (a popular, free, and open-source distribution of Java).
2. Select your Operating System (e.g., Windows), Architecture (e.g., x64), and Package Type (`JDK`).
3. Download the installer (e.g., the `.msi` file for Windows or `.pkg` for macOS) and run it.
4. **Important for Windows Users:** During installation, make sure to enable the option **"Set or Add to JAVA_HOME environment variable"** and **"Add to PATH"**.

**To verify Java is installed:**
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:
```bash
java -version
```
You should see a message mentioning Java version 21.

*Note: You do not need to install Maven, as this project uses a "Maven Wrapper" (`mvnw`) which automatically downloads the required build tools for you.*

## Downloading the Project

If you haven't already downloaded the project to your computer, you will need to get it from GitHub.

**Option 1: Download as a ZIP File (Easiest)**
1. Go to the project's page on GitHub.
2. Click the green **Code** button.
3. Select **Download ZIP**.
4. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer (e.g., `Documents/vaadin-example-project`).

**Option 2: Clone using Git (For developers)**
If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone <URL_OF_THE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY>
```

## How to Open the Project

To view and edit the code, you should use an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**. An IDE is advanced software that makes writing and running code much easier.

**Recommended IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (Free Community Edition)**
1. Go to the [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Download Page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. Scroll down to the **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** and download it.
3. Run the installer and open IntelliJ IDEA.
4. Click **Open** (or File -> Open) and browse to the folder where you extracted or cloned the project (select the folder containing the `pom.xml` file).
5. Click **OK**. IntelliJ will start downloading necessary dependencies and indexing the project. This may take a few minutes the first time.

*(Alternatively, you can use Eclipse or Visual Studio Code with the Java Extension Pack).*

## How to Run the Project

You can run this project directly from your terminal/command prompt.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project's main folder (the folder containing the `pom.xml` file). For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/vaadin-example-project
   ```
3. Run the application using the Maven wrapper:
   - **On Windows:**
     ```cmd
     .\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
     ```
   - **On macOS / Linux:**
     ```bash
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

4. Wait for the project to finish downloading dependencies, compiling, and starting up. You will see several log messages. 
5. Look for a message that says `Started [ApplicationName] in X.XXX seconds`.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to:
   **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

You should now see the application running! To stop the application, return to your terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

## Detailed Project Structure

This project uses the standard layout for a Spring Boot and Vaadin application. Here's a breakdown of what the different files and folders do:

```text
vaadin-example-project/
│
├── pom.xml                 # The most important configuration file! It tells Maven what libraries
│                           # the project needs (Spring Boot, Vaadin, Spring Security, H2 Database).
│
├── mvnw / mvnw.cmd         # Maven Wrapper scripts. These allow you to build the project without
│                           # having to install Maven manually.
│
├── src/                    # The folder containing all the source code for the project.
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/           # This directory holds all the Java backend code.
│   │   │   └── com/...     # Contains the application launcher, Vaadin Views (UI screens),
│   │   │                   # Services (business logic), entities (database models), and security configs.
│   │   │
│   │   ├── frontend/       # This folder contains frontend resources like TypeScript/JavaScript
│   │   │                   # files, Vaadin component configurations, and custom styles (CSS).
│   │   │
│   │   └── resources/      # This folder contains static assets and configuration files.
│   │       ├── application.properties  # App settings like server port, database connection configs, etc.
│   │       └── ...         # Icons, images, and HTML templates.
│   │
│   └── test/               # Contains automated tests for the project.
│       └── java/           # Java unit tests and Spring Boot integration tests.
│
├── .gitignore              # Tells Git which files/folders it should ignore (e.g., compiled code).
└── target/                 # Created automatically when the project is built. Contains compiled code.
```

### Key Technologies Used
* **Spring Boot:** The core backend framework handling the server, routing, and configuration.
* **Vaadin:** A web framework that allows developers to write user interfaces (UI) entirely in Java. It handles the frontend automatically.
* **Spring Security:** Provides authentication and authorization for the app.
* **Spring Data JPA & H2 Database:** Used for saving and loading data. H2 is configured as a file-based database (stored in the `./data` folder), meaning your notes and data will persist (be saved) even if you restart the application.

## Common Issues / Troubleshooting

### 1. `The JAVA_HOME environment variable is not defined correctly`
**What it means:** The application cannot find your Java installation or you haven't told your system where it is.
**How to fix:** 
- Make sure you actually installed Java 21 (see Prerequisites). 
- If Java is installed, you need to set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the folder where Java was installed (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21`). Ensure the path does **not** end with `\bin`.
- After setting the variable, you **must close your current terminal window and open a new one** before trying again.

### 2. `Port 8080 was already in use`
**What it means:** Another application (or another instance of this project) is currently running and using the default port.
**How to fix:** Find the terminal running the application and press `Ctrl+C` to stop it. If you can't find it, you can restart your computer, or change the `server.port` setting inside `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

### 3. Changes don't appear in the browser
**What it means:** Sometimes your browser caches older files.
**How to fix:** Try completely refreshing the page (`Ctrl + F5` on Windows, `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac). If that doesn't help, restart the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in your terminal and running the `spring-boot:run` command again.
